We will learn how to create a new user and login as that created user 
-   'useradd' - add a new user
-   'usermod' - modify an existing user
-   'userdel' - delete a user 

CREATE A USER NAMED 'john'
-   'useradd -m john' 

MODIFY THE USER 'john' TO USE '/bin/bash' INSTEAD OF '/bin/sh'
-   'usermod -s /bin/bash john'

VIEW USER PASSWORDS
-   'cat /etc/shadow'

LOGIN AS JOHN 
-   Open a new terminal window
-   Run the command 'docker ps' to view all active containers
-   Then run 'docker exec -it -u john f4f0dec2a1da bash'
