We have two deployment options : -
1-  Single-host deployment
2-  Cluster deployment

Advantages of single-host
1-  Very easy to configure

Disadvantages of Single-host
1-  If our server goes offline, our application will not be aceesible
2-  If our app goes rapidly and get 100k+ users, a single server will not be able to handle the load

Advantages of cluster
1-  High availability and scalability

To run Cluster, you need orchestration tools : - Docker swarm (not popular), Kubernetes (google product)

Our focus will be Single-host deployment.
