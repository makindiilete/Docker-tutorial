-   VIEW RUNNING CONTAINERS
docker ps
ps stands for process, a container is just a process on the computer system with its own file system....

-   Start a container using our 'react-app' image
docker run react-app
With this mode, the container will start but you will not be able to do something else in the terminal..
You can start the container in the background so the terminal is free to run other things

-   Start a container in detached mode
docker run -d react-app

-   When a container is running, docker give each container a random name which can be found under the NAMES column
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS      NAMES
281c332cebbe   react-app   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   12 minutes ago   Up 12 minutes   3000/tcp   affectionate_sutherland

So we can reference a container with this name or the id..

-   Start a container giving it a specific name of your own
docker run -d --name blue-sky react-app

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS      NAMES
5a4d9ac03e29   react-app   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   12 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds    3000/tcp   blue-sky
281c332cebbe   react-app   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   14 minutes ago   Up 14 minutes   3000/tcp   affectionate_sutherland
