Each container has their own file system which is invisible to other containers..
TO test this out we will
-   With two containers running, start a shell session in the first container
-   Write something to a file and then exit
-   Start the 2nd container and filter to see if the file name exist in the second container... U wont see this

-   When you delete a container, it is deleted together with its file system, this is why we should not store information into the container's file system but we should store it inside VOLUME
