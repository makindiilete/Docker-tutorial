By default, docker create our app with the root user which has the ultimate privildges. This can open us up to security flaws so we will create a user with limited privileges and use it to run our app..

CREATING A USER
-   Run the command 'docker run -it alpine'


DOCKER FILE
FROM node:14.17.0-alpine3.13
RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app ---> Add a group named 'app' then add a system user named 'app' into the created group named 'app'
USER app --> set the user as 'app' so all commands after this line will be using the created user (app)
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
ENV API_URL=http://api.myapp.com/
EXPOSE 3000

Rebuild the image... docker build -t react-app .


NOW WE CAN VERIFY IF THE CURRENT USER HAS BEEN SET AS app
-   run the command >> docker run -it react-app sh
-   run the command >> whoami
-   it should print 'app'
