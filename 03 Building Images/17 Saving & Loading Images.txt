Saving and loading images is a scenario when you want to move and image from one machine to another without going through docker hub..
In this case you can save the image as a compressed file and load it on the other machine...

SAVING
docker image save -o react-app.tar react-app (.tar in linux is like .zip in windows)

It will take a while and when its done, we can check the root folder of our app and we will see the .tar file


LOADING IMAGES
Now lets delete our react-app and try to load it back from the tar file

-   docker image rm react-app
-   to load --> docker image load -i react-app.tar
-   Now we can verify it with 'docker images'
