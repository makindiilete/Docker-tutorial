Now inside our Dockerfile, we need to use the RUN statement to run our npm install or any command we will normally run in our terminal session

FROM node:14.17.0-alpine3.13
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install


-   Now if U run 'docker run -it react-app sh' again followed by 'ls' >> We will see our node_modules again
