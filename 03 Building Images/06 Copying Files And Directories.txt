Now that we have a base image, the next step is to copy the application files into the base image..
-   We can copy using wither COPY or ADD.. ADD comes with some additional features which we will talk about later

FROM node:14.17.0-alpine3.13
WORKDIR /app  >> Set a working dir
COPY . .  >> Copy everything inside the root dir into the working directory
COPY ["hello world.txt", "."]  >> Use ds syntax instead of the one above if you want to copy file with space in the file name

ADD features
-   ADD http://.../file.json . >> Copying a file from the internet into our image
-   ADD file.zip . >> If u pass a compress file, add will automatically uncompress it and pass it into our image

*   FOR BEST PRACTICE, STICK WITH COPY because it is straight-forward and there is no magic around it..
FROM node:14.17.0-alpine3.13
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .



-   Next we rebuild the image 'docker build -t react-app .'
-   Next start the container in shell env with 'docker run -it react-app sh'
