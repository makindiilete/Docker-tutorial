To build our docker image, we run the command below

docker build -t react-app .    --> react-app is d name of the image to build

This command must be run inside the root folder of our app where the docker file is located...

After Building, to run the image in a container, we run the command --> docker run -it react-app sh (shell environment) or docker run -it react-app (ds will run nodejs terminal bcos we are running base of node:14.17.0-alpine3.13)
