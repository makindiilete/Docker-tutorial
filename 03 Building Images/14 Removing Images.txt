When we run 'docker images', we see many images without a name and tag, this are called dangling images..
To remove them, run : 'docker container prune' >>> then run 'docker image prune'

Now if you run 'docker images' again, you see only the images you have created or pulled from docker hub..

To remove an image that is not a dangling image i.e. One of the images you created or pulled from docker hub, you run the command

docker image rm image-name e.g. docker image rm hello-docker


RUn 'docker image' to view all available commands
