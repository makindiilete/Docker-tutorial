IMAGES
An image contains everything an app needs to run including but not limited to : - 
-   A cut-down OS on which the app will run on
-   Third party libraries
-   Application files
-   Environment variables

CONTAINER
Once an image has been setup, we can start a container which is like a virtual machine/computer where will host this 'everything an app needs to run' i.e. an image.
-   Provides an isolated environment 
-   Can be stopped and restarted 
-   Is just a process

We can start/create multiple containers from the same image but each container is isolated, they do not share their content with other containers even though there is a way to view the content of a container from another container.
