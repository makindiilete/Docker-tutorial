Docker file

FROM node:14.17.0-alpine3.13
#   Create a group named 'app' and create a system user named 'app'
RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app
#   Set the created user 'app' as the current user and use it to run all the next commands
USER app
#   Set our working directory as /app
WORKDIR /app
#   Copy all files inside current dir
COPY . .
#   Run npm install command to install all dependencies
RUN npm install
#   Set an env var named 'API_URL'
ENV API_URL=http://api.myapp.com/
#   Set 3000 as the port to use to run our app
EXPOSE 3000
#   Execute form : - in this process, no shell or terminal is needed, it is run directly.. THIS IS RECOMMENDED
#   This also makes it faster to clean up resources when we stop the container
CMD ["npm", "start"]
#   Shell form : - in this process, the container will run this in a shell terminal or command prompt
#   CMD npm start




NOTE : - It it not advisable to have multiple 'CMD' commands inside a docker file because in such scenario, only the last one will be executed and the previous ones will be ignored...

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUN AND CMD
We can use both to run a specific instructions but the RUN command is a build time command e.g. When building the image
While the CMD command is a run time command i.e. do something after the container has started
