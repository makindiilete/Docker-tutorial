Docker uses a client to server architecture where the client talks to the server via restful api...
The server is also called the DOCKER ENGINE and it sits in the background taking care of running and building containers.
On your computer e.g. on windows task manager, you have many running processes, a container is just one of this process but a special kind of process which we will talk about soon.
