This will tell us the process of making an application run with docker...
1.  We take an application (any type of app e.g. nodejs or react)
2.  We dockerize it by adding a special type of file 'Dockerfile' >> This file contains instructions on how docker will package this app and turn it into a docker image. That image contains all the files our app needs to run e.g. Node v12, npm etc
3.  Once we have a docker image, we tell docker to start a container using that image which is to start a process on the pc...
4.  Now once the image is ready, we can push it to dockerhub which is like the github of docker so its like pushing our code to a github repository which can then be downloaded by any machine running on docker which can then be our test or production environment.
