We will see how we can dockerize a very simple application
1.  Open your terminal
2.  Create a new directory 'hello-docker' >> Switch to the folder and open the folder in your Editor
3.  Add 'app.js' file and print a console statement 'console.log("Hello docker"); 
4.  We will assume this is our application and we will try to dockerize it

DOCKERIZATION
1.  Add a new file to the app root directory 'Dockerfile' without extension

/*


# start from a node image using alpine so dt our image size will not be too big
FROM node:alpine
# copy all the files in this directory into a new directory to b created in the container named 'app'
COPY . /app
# Command to run our app
# CMD node /app/app.js
# OR
# We can set the working directory where the command sud b executed from so we wont need /app/app.js
# all the instructions after the WORKDIR instructions assumes we are working from the /app directory
WORKDIR /app
CMD node app.js


*/

2.  Next we need to build our docker image
3.  Open the terminal from the hello-docker folder and run the command 'docker build -t hello-docker .'
the '-t' tag is use to specify a tag name to identify the image with and the . signifies it sud build from the current directory'.. u can replace with the directory path if you are not building from the current directory.
4.  Wait for the code to execute.. Now you can list all the images on the pc to confirm if your image was created by using 'docker image ls'

RUNNING A DOCKER IMAGE ON THE COMPUTER IT WAS CREATED
On your machine wher the image was created running docker. U can run the code 'docker run hello-docker' from any directory and it should print our message to the console.

RUNNING OUR IMAGE ON ANOTHER MACHINE
To run the image on another machine, you need to publish your image to docker hub and then from another machine, you can pull it and run the app
1.  Push your code to a github repo
2.  Create a repo on docker hub and push your code to it
3.  On another machine running docker or https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
4.  Sign in and click on START >> Add a new Instance >> Get the docker hub repo name and run the command to pull "docker pull codewithmosh/hello-docker"
