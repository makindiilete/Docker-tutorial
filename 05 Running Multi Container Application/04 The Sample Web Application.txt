Attached to this video is our sample web application containing the frontend and backend of an application..

If we are to run this web app outside of docker, we will have to follow some steps : -
1-  Run npm install inside the backend project
2-  Run npm install inside the frontend project
3-  Install mongodb...

But with docker, we do not need to do any of these steps...

If we check our root folder, we have a 'docker-compose.yml' file.. This is used to compose a multi container application and all we need to do next is run 'docker-compose up'

This will pull and install all necessary things and then start a development server for you to run the application on....
Run this port on localhost to see the web app live and interact with the app without any need installing mongodb or npm install on ur pc
